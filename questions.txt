1. Lex program to count capital, small letters, number of words, lines, total characters and string containing bbb substring
2. Accept strings starting and ending with same Symbol (0/1) 
3. Accept strings with odd no. Of a's and even no. of b's
4. Write a lex program to identify and count the number of arithmetic, relational and logical operations in a given c program file
5. YACC - identifiers
6. Write lex program to accept valid email address

8. a^m b^n where m+n is odd
9. YACC - if else
10. write a lex program which takes an input c file and (a) copies to output file with changing int to float (b) count identifiers with length more than 5 (c) count no of statements.
11. Take from file and count no of words with vowel count>2, Count no of words with length>5, Count no of words with no vowels, Count no of words, Count no of lines
12. a^m b^n c^p where m>=2, n<=2, p<=2
